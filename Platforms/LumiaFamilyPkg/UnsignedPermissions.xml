    Sample Unsigned Permission file.  The following settings will be allowed to be updated
    using unsigned settings packets.  This file must be customized for every platform, and
    included in the platform .fdf file like:

    FILE FREEFORM = PCD(gDfciPkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdUnsignedPermissionsFile) {
      SECTION RAW = YourPlatform/Somewhere/UnsignedPermissions.xml
    }

NOTE:
    None of the Permission Masks or the Delegated Masks are actually used.  However, they
    must be present for the parser.  This include Default, Delegated, Append, PMask, and DMask
    values. While this .xml file shows the actual values, they are not from this file.
